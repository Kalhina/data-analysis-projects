# data-analysis-projects

### Data analysis notebooks, algorithms, visualizations

Hello! 

This is a repository dedicated to data analysis projects, mostly with the Python programming language. The projects are separated into different notebooks although they might convey similar ideas.

To view the notebooks, you can use [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/uribalb/data-analysis-projects/tree/develop/) but due to the absence of a live ipython kernel, some of the output cells might be broken.

Feel free to contribute to any of those projects
